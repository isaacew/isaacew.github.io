In addition, a risk measurement is formulated based upon the concept of Dynamic Maneuvering Cue (DMC) which measures the amount of turn a vehicle would need to take in its current state in order to put itself outside the threat region. This approach is then extended to handle multiple threat regions simultaneously (with minimal additional computational complexity). Finally, the DMC constraint is applied to a simple feedback controller as well as a model predictive controller (MPC). The MPC shows better performance but at the cost of having to solve an optimization problem online versus the meager computational burden associated with the simple controller. This approach, which is based on assuming the threats are adversarial, may be used as a conservative method for collision avoidance and deconfliction.},

@article{surve2025mutual,
  abstract = {We introduce a pursuit game played between a team of a sensor and an attacker and a mobile target in the unbounded Euclidean plane. The target is faster than the sensor, but slower than the attacker. The sensor’s objective is to keep the target within a sensing radius so that the attacker can capture the target, whereas the target seeks to escape by reaching beyond the sensing radius from the sensor without getting captured by the attacker. We assume that as long as the target is within the sensing radius from the sensor, the sensor-attacker team is able to measure the target’s instantaneous position and velocity. We pose and solve this problem as a game of kind in which the target uses an open-loop strategy (passive target). Aside from the novel formulation, our contributions are four-fold. First, we present optimal strategies for both the sensor and the attacker, according to their respective objectives. Specifically, we design a sensor strategy that maximizes the duration for which the target remains within its sensing range, while the attacker uses proportional navigation to capture the target. Second, we characterize the sensable region – the region in the plane in which the target remains within the sensing radius of the sensor during the game – and show that capture is guaranteed if and only if the Apollonius circle between the attacker and the target is fully contained within this region. Third, we derive a lower bound on the target’s speed below which capture is guaranteed, and an upper bound on the target speed above which there exists an escape strategy for the target, from an arbitrary initial orientation between the agents. Fourth, for a given initial orientation between the agents, we present a sharper upper bound on the target speed above which there exists an escape strategy for the target.},

This property is instrumental for leveraging geometric approaches for solving multiple pursuit-evasion scenarios in the plane. Here, we study a pursuit-evasion differential game on a sphere and generalize the planar Apollonius circle to the spherical domain. For the differential game, we provide equilibrium strategies for all initial conditions, including a special case when the pursuer and evader are on opposite sides of the sphere where a dilemma occurs. In contrast to planar scenarios, on the sphere we find that the interception point from the equilibrium strategies can leave the Apollonius domain boundary. We present a condition to ensure the intercept point remains on the boundary of the Apollonius domain. This condition allows for generalizing planar pursuit-evasion strategies to the sphere, and we show how these results are applied by analyzing the scenarios of target guarding and two-pursuer, single evader differential games on the sphere.},

The vehicle is models by Dubins kinematics, and the objective is to determine the shortest path that reaches the target within the sensor’s range and lies in its FOV. The limited range of the sensor manifests as a constraint to reach a circle centered at target’s position and radius equal to sensor range. The field of view constraints are expressed as coupled constraints on terminal position and heading. Using Pontryagin’s minimum principle, we show that optimal solution could have at most two segments, a turn or a straight line for each segment. Straight line segments occur exclusively when the final position is located on the boundary of the target circle. Furthermore, we provide an analytical approach for computing optimal paths in scenarios where the optimality conditions lead to complex geometric configurations.},

The weapons are assumed to have simple motion, while the vehicles carrying the weapons are modeled with Dubins dynamics. Three scenarios are investigated and are differentiated in the assumptions that can be made about the target in the process of the vehicle control design: 1) no knowledge of target control, 2) avoid unsafe positions assuming the target's optimal control, 3) full knowledge of target's optimal control. The engagement is formulated as a stochastic optimal control problem with uncertainty in the target's control modeled using a noise parameter applied to the target's control input. After discretizing the Hamilton-Jacobi-Bellman equation, Value iteration is then used to obtain an approximate solution for the optimal vehicle control and time-to-go. Simulation results support usage of the first paradigm: assume no knowledge of the target's control.},

@article{weintraub2025virtual,
  abstract = {This paper considers an 𝑁 -pursuer–𝑀 -evader scenario involving 𝐿 virtual targets. The virtual targets serve as an intermediary target for the pursuers, allowing the pursuers to delay their final assignment to the evaders. However, upon reaching the virtual target, the pursuers must decide which evader to capture. It is assumed that there are more pursuers than evaders and that the pursuers are faster than the evaders. The objective is two-part: first, assign each pursuer to a virtual target and evader such that the pursuer team’s energy is minimized, and, second, choose the virtual targets’ locations for this minimization problem. The approach taken is to consider the Apollonius geometry between each pursuer’s virtual target location and each evader. Using the constructed Apollonius circles, the pursuer’s travel distance and maneuver at a virtual target are obtained. These metrics serve as a gauge for the total energy required to capture a particular evader and are used to solve the joint virtual target selection and pursuer–evader assignment problem. This paper provides a mathematical definition of this problem, the solution approach taken, and an example. Following the example, a Monte Carlo analysis is performed, demonstrating the efficacy of the algorithm and its suitability for real-time applications.},

The second approach uses a discrete-time, data-driven KO representation with control to calculate open- loop control policies one trajectory at a time.

First, we formally establish that the optimal heterogeneous intercept problem is equivalent to solving an appropriately defined Euclidean Traveling Salesperson Problem with Neighborhoods (ETSPN). We show that each neighborhood is an ellipse with a specified center and lengths of the major and minor axis. Second, we provide novel upper bounds on the optimal length as a function of the problem parameters, i.e., the number of targets, the speed ratio between the target and the assembly, the speed between the pursuer and the assembly, the geometry of the region containing the targets and the time required for the pursuer to intercept a target.

The scenario is formulated as a two-player, zero-sum differential game and solved via the method of characteristics (i.e., back-propagation of equilibrium trajectories). Three different trajectory types make up the solution: trajectories that end with the turret aligned with the mobile agent, trajectories that end with the mobile agent on the constraint boundary, and regular trajectories.},

@inproceedings{wolek2024sampling-based,
  abstract = {Existing methods for avoiding dynamic engagement zones (EZs) and minimizing risk leverage the calculus of variations to obtain optimal paths. While such methods are deterministic, they scale poorly as the number of engagement zones increases. Furthermore, optimal-control based strategies are sensitive to initial guesses and often converge to local, rather than global, minima. This paper presents a novel sampling-based approach to obtain a feasible flight plan for a Dubins vehicle to reach a desired location in a bounded operating region in the presence of a large number of engagement zones. The dynamic EZs are coupled to the vehicle dynamics through its heading angle. Thus, the dynamic two-dimensional obstacles in the (x, y) plane can be transformed into three-dimensional static obstacles in a lifted (x, y, ψ) space. This insight is leveraged in the formulation of a Rapidly-exploring Random Tree (RRT∗) algorithm. The algorithm is evaluated with a Monte Carlo experiment that randomizes EZ locations to characterize the success rate and average path length as a function of the number of EZs and as the computation time made available to the planner is increased.},

This property was exploited for the construction of the equilibrium strategies for two faster pursuers against one evader. Extensions for planar multiple-pursuer single-evader scenarios have been considered. We study a pursuit-evasion game on a sphere and the relation of the equilibrium intercept point to the Apollonius domain on the sphere. The domain is a generalization of the planar Apollonius circle set.

𝐿 is assumed to begin inside the circle and wishes to escape to the perimeter with some finite angular separation from 𝑀 at the perimeter. This scenario has, in the past, been formulated as a zerosum differential game wherein 𝐿 seeks to maximize terminal separation and 𝑀 seeks to minimize it. Its solution is well-known. However, there is a large portion of the state space for which the canonical solution does not yield a unique equilibrium strategy.

In the auxiliary differential game, 𝐿 seeks to reach a point opposite of 𝑀 at a radius for which their maximum angular speeds are equal (i.e., the antipodal point). 𝐿 wishes to minimize the time to reach this point while 𝑀 wishes to maximize it. The solution of the auxiliary differential game is comprised of a Focal Line, a Universal Line, and their tributaries.

In the event of an engagement, the Mobile Agent may have to actively evade the Threat in order to guarantee survival. Provided the Engagement Zone definition, several fundamental engagement models are described and their corresponding Engagement Zones are derived. In each of the engagement models, the Mobile Agent is treated as an Evader; they include pursuit-evasion against a range-limited Pursuer moving with simple motion and faster speed, a variation in which the Pursuer is slower, and a turret-evasion scenario against a range-limited, turn-rate-limited Turret. The slow Pursuer Engagement Zone is applied to a path planning scenario wherein the Mobile Agent must reach a desired target in minimum time while navigating outside the dynamically changing Engagement Zone. Numerical results demonstrate the advantage of Engagement Zone-based navigation over other path plans based on circumnavigation.},

@misc{weintraub2024deterministic,
  abstract = {Previous methods for avoiding dynamic engagement zones leverage the calculus of variations to obtain optimal path plans for avoiding risk and reaching a desired target location [1,2]. While this method is deterministic; it scales poorly as the number of engagement zones increases. Furthermore, it is inherently sensitive to initial guesses and finding local minimums can be problematic. This talk presents a novel approach that uses deterministic approaches to obtain a set of feasible flight plans for reaching the desired destination and reports when no such plan exists. Furthermore, it uses an efficient scheme for feeding initial guesses to a nonlinear program solver that provides flyable path plans that mitigate risk. Lastly, a tool is developed that measures the risk of the flight path for avoiding a large field of engagement zones, providing useful information to improve battle management. The solution process begins with using the location of each weapon engagement zone and associated model to obtain a Voronoi partition of the environment. This partitioning is used to construct a feasibility graph signifying navigation through each pair of weapon engagement zones. Once constructed each edge of the graph borders two opposing weapon engagement zones for which the target vehicle aims to navigate between. If the pair of engagement zones can not be penetrated due to the distance and size of those zones; then the associated edge of the graph is deleted. This process is iteratively performed until each edge has been evaluated. Upon completion of the feasibility graph, path plans are attained using graph-based search to minimize the time of arrival. Next, the provided solution is fed to a nonlinear program solver that smooths the solution or solutions from the feasibility path according to the vehicle dynamics. The resulting solutions are analyzed through a simplified simulation to assess risk and time of arrival.  Presented are the methods used to solve this navigational problem, results of the simulated trajectories, and future research directions. [1] Isaac E. Weintraub, Alexander Von Moll, Christian A.

@misc{milutinovic2024stochastic,
  abstract = {Description: Recent efforts in planning paths for a vehicle around dynamic engagement zones have been based upon optimal control solved via nonlinear program comprised of a pseudospectral direct collocation of the dynamics and constraints. The engagement zone(s) rotate and scale based upon the position and aspect angle of the vehicle, respectively. Initially, the problem setup was based upon a vehicle navigating around a stationary, gimballed threat to reach a specified goal position; the entire engagement took place on a 2D plane [1]. As a follow-on effort, two dynamic engagement zones were considered along with an added vehicle turning-rate constraint [2]. In all of these works, the solution consisted of a single optimal trajectory associated with a particular initial condition. In this presentation, three extensions are considered and demonstrated: 1) stochasticity via the inclusion of a Wiener process (Brownian motion) in the dynamics, 2) computation of an optimal feedback control law, and 3) multiple engagement zones (even beyond 2). The stochastic process may represent uncertainty due to wind, other environmental factors, or position measurement errors. In the case of a single engagement zone the stochastic process may represent the vehicle’s uncertainty about the location of the engagement zone. Regarding the feedback control law, this is a much more powerful result than a single path plan as it requires that the control law be computed once, a priori, and can then be used for any position in the state space, whereas the existing path plan-based solutions require re-computation for each new position in the state space. Having the feedback control law and Value function everywhere is also illustrative of the overall behavior of optimal trajectories – e.g., some optimal trajectories fly around while others fly between neighboring engagement zones. Lastly, the methodology can be applied to larger numbers of engagement zones. When based on Value iteration [3], the Value function computation scales at least sub-exponentially with the number of engagement zones.

  abstract = {This investigation seeks to obtain estimates on the intercept time associated with a fast Pursuer implementing Pure Pursuit against a Target whose trajectory is a circular arc. The analytical solution of the kinematic equations of motion is not feasible and thus the baseline approach for computing the intercept time is numerical simulation, i.e., numerical integration of the kinematics. This method can obtain the intercept time in (essentially) real time for a single Pursuer against a single Target. Here, the goal is to estimate the intercept time using orders of magnitude less computational time. Although not explicitly explored in this work, the purpose of such approximations is to make feasible the rapid evaluation of Pursuer-to-Target assignments in a massive many-on-many engagement scenario wherein the intercept time may be a key measure. Several approximation methods are proposed here and their merits (or lack thereof) are demonstrated through simulation. Ultimately, assuming the Target is not actually turning may be suitable when its turn radius is relatively large, while assuming intercept occurs at the closest point on the turn circle may be suitable when its turn radius is relatively small.},

The virtual targets serve as an intermediary target for the pursuers, allowing the pursuers to delay their final assignment to the evaders. However, upon reaching the virtual target, the pursuers must decide which evader to capture. It is assumed that there are more pursuers than evaders and that the pursuers are faster than the evaders. The objective is two-part: first, assign each pursuer to virtual target and evader such that the the pursuer team’s energy is minimized, and second, choose the the virtual targets’ locations for this minimization problem. The approach taken is to consider the Apollonius geometry between each pursuer’s virtual target location and each evader. Using the constructed Apollonius circles, the pursuer’s travel distance and maneuver at a virtual target are obtained. These metrics serve as a gauge for the total energy required to capture a particular evader and are used to solve the joint virtual target selection and pursuer-evader assignment problem.

  abstract = {The work herein expresses an optimal control problem for an air vehicle to reach a desired location through two dynamic keep out zones. In today’s contested world, there are many instances where air vehicles are denied a portion of the airspace when trying to reach a desired target. Under these conditions the objective is to find the optimal route to the desired location while obeying path constraints. In this work, the path constraint is defined as the enemy’s ground weapon engagement zone, and is established in a way that simulates an anti-aircraft defense system. The vehicle’s objective is to reach the desired location in minimum time while completely avoiding the engagement zone. This optimal control problem is considered in the Cartesian plane, has a fixed final state, and free final time. The dynamics of the aircraft are a function of the aircraft’s velocity and heading. The velocity of the aircraft is assumed to be constant and the vehicle’s control is its heading rate. The engagement zone, which acts as a path constraint, is dynamic in that its effective range is a function of the engagement zone’s instantaneous line of sight angle and the aircraft’s instantaneous bearing angle. The desired final location is defined to be a point opposite the engagement zone from the aircraft’s initial location. Several scenarios are conducted to show path trajectories through multiple dynamic engagement zones. Results illustrate how aircraft dynamic maneuvers can minimize total flight time to a target while maintaining a safe distance from enemy threats. Further, while investigating multiple engagement zones, it is shown that an aircraft can maintain safe separation from multiple overlapping threats by manipulating relative bearing angles and the aircraft’s heading.},

  abstract = {In this paper, a zero-sum differential game is formulated and solved in which a mobile Evader seeks to escape from within a circle at whose origin lies a stationary, turn-constrained Turret. The scenario is a variant of the famous Lady in the Lake game in which the shore-constrained Pursuer has been replaced with the Turret. As in the former, it is assumed that the Turret's maximum angular rate is greater than the linear velocity of the Evader. Since two outcomes are possible, a Game of Kind arises - either the Evader wins by reaching the perimeter of the circle, or the Turret wins by aligning with the latter's position. A barrier surface partitions the state space into two regions corresponding to these two outcomes and a Game of Degree is solved within each region. The solutions to the Games of Degree are comprised of the Value functions (i.e., the equilibrium value of the cost/utility as a function of the state) and the saddle-point equilibrium control policies for the two players. Like the Lady in the Lake game, the equilibrium policy of the Evader is not uniquely de ned where it has angular rate advantage over the Turret. Unlike the Lady in the Lake game, the losing region for the Evader is present for all speed ratios, and there is an additional semi-permeable surface separating center- and shore-bound Evader trajectories. The solution depends heavily upon the speed ratio of the agents; in particular, there are two speed ratio regimes with distinctive solution structures.},

Specifically, for the offline approach, we establish that for general parameter regimes, this problem is equivalent to solving a Travelling Repairperson Problem with Time Windows (TRP- TW). We then identify specific parameter regimes in which there is a polynomial time algorithm that maximizes the number of intruders captured. For the online approach we present a competitive analysis technique in which we establish a fundamental guarantee on the existence of at best (N − 1)- competitive algorithms and design two online algorithms that are provably 1 and 2-competitive in specific parameter regimes.},

The intruders’ objective is to breach the target boundary without being captured by the defender. As soon as the current intruder breaches the target or gets captured by the defender, the next intruder appears at a random location on a fixed circle surrounding the target. Therefore, the defender’s final location at the end of the current game becomes its initial location for the next game. Thus, the players pick strategies that are advantageous for the current as well as for the future games. Depending on the information available to the players, each game is divided into two phases: partial information and full information phase. Under some assumptions on the sensing and speed capabilities, we analyze each agent’s strategy in both phases. We derive equilibrium strategies for both the players to optimize the capture percentage using the notions of engagement surface and capture circle. We quantify the percentage of capture for both finite and infinite sequences of incoming intruders.},

The problems considered in this paper concern a Pursuer, implementing pure pursuit (i.e., line of sight guidance), chasing an Evader who holds course. Previous results are applicable to the case in which capture is defined as the two agents being coincident, i.e., point capture. The focus here is on obtaining results for the more realistic case  where the pursuer is endowed with an effector whose range is finite. The scenario in which the Evader begins inside the Pursuer's effector range is also considered (i.e., escape from persistent surveillance, among other potential applications). Questions herein addressed include: does the engagement end in head-on collision or tail chase, will the Evader be captured or escape, what is the minimum distance the Pursuer will attain, for two Pursuers, is simultaneous capture/escape optimal and, if so, what is the optimal heading for the Evader (max time to capture, or min time to escape), and the feasibility for a fast Evader to escape from many Pursuers. Where possible, closed-form, analytic results are obtained, otherwise attention is given to computability with an eye towards real-time, on-board implementation.},

@thesis{vonmoll2022skirmish-level,
  abstract = {Supremacy in armed conflict comes not merely from superiority in capability or numbers but from how assets are used, down to the maneuvers of individual vehicles and munitions. This document outlines a research plan focused on skirmish-level tactics to militarily relevant scenarios. Skirmish-level refers to both the size of the adversarial engagement -- generally one vs. one, two vs. one, and/or one vs. two -- as well as the fact that the goal or objective of each team is well-established. The problem areas include pursuit-evasion and target guarding, either of which may be considered as sub-problems within military missions such as air-to-air combat, suppression/defense of ground-based assets, etc. In most cases, the tactics considered are comprised of the control policy of the agents (i.e., their spatial maneuvers), but may also include role assignment (e.g, whether to act as a decoy or striker) as well as discrete decisions (e.g., whether to engage or retreat). Skirmish-level tactics are important because they can provide insight into how to approach larger scale conflicts (many vs. many, many objectives, many decisions). Machine learning approaches such as reinforcement learning and neural networks have been demonstrated to be capable of developing controllers for large teams of agents. However, the performance of these controllers compared to the optimal (or equilibrium) policies is generally unknown. Differential Game Theory provides the means to obtain a rigorous solution to relevant scenarios in the form of saddle-point equilibrium control policies and the min/max (or max/min) cost / reward in the case of zero-sum games. When the equilibrium control policies can be obtained analytically, they are suitable for onboard / real-time implementation. Some challenges associated with the classical Differential Game Theory approach are explored herein. These challenges arise mainly due to the presence of singularities, which may appear in even the simplest differential games. The utility of skirmish-level solutions is demonstrated in (i) the multiple pursuer, single evader differential games, (ii) multi-agent turret defense scenarios, and (iii) engage or retreat scenarios. In its culmination, this work contributes differential game and optimal control solutions to novel scenarios, numerical techniques for computing singular surfaces, approximations for computationally-intensive solutions, and techniques for addressing scenarios with multiple stages or outcomes.},

@article{vonmoll2022lock-evade,
  abstract = {In this paper we model and analyze a scenario in the two-dimensional plane involving a mobile Attacker and stationary Defender. There are two possibilities for termination: the Attacker can collide with the Defender (engagement) or maneuver to a safe zone away from the Defender (retreat). The Defender is equipped with a directional turret, which it can rotate with a bounded rate. If the turret is aligned with the Attacker’s position, the Defender has a lock on the Attacker and may choose to fire on the Attacker. Thus, whether engaging or retreating, the Attacker has incentive to evade the turret’s line of sight and thereby avoid being locked-on. In the case of retreat, if lock-on occurs the Defender cooperates with the Attacker by withholding fire to allow the Attacker to retreat. However, if the Attacker chooses to engage and lock-on occurs, the Defender will open fire on the Attacker. We model the scenario as a set of differential games with different cost functionals depending on the type of termination. The agents are assumed to have full state information. In the case that the Defender can lock onto the Attacker the pre- and post-lock portions of the game are solved individually and combined together. Otherwise, the Attacker can terminate the game prior to lock-on and the game is comprised of a single stage. The equilibrium strategies are derived in each case, and a partitioning of the state space wherein a particular goal selection is optimal is constructed.},

It is well known that the interior of the Apollonius Circle (AC) is the evader's dominance region, however, it was unclear whether the evader could reach outside the initial AC without being captured. We construct a pursuit strategy that guarantees the capture of an evader within an arbitrarily close neighborhood of the initial AC. The pursuer strategy is derived by reformulating the game into a nonlinear control problem, and the guarantee holds against any admissible evader strategy. Our result implies that the evader can freely select the capture location, but only inside the initial AC. Therefore, a class of problems, including those where the payoff is determined solely based on the location of capture, are now trivial.},

We present a competitive analysis approach to this problem by measuring the performance of multiple online algorithms for the vehicle against arbitrary inputs relative to an optimal offline algorithm that has access to all future inputs. In particular, we first establish a necessary condition on the parameter space to guarantee finite competitiveness of any algorithm and then characterize parameter regime in which one must expect a competitive ratio of at least 2. We then design and analyze three online algorithms and characterize parameter regimes for which they have finite competitive ratios. Specifically, our first two algorithms are provably 1, and 2-competitive, respectively, whereas our third algorithm exhibits a finite competitive ratio that depends on the problem parameters. Finally, we provide numerous parameter space plots providing insights into the relative performance of our algorithms.},

When the Turret's look angle is aligned with an Attacker, that Attacker is neutralized.  In this paper, we focus on a region of the state space wherein only one of the Attackers is able to reach the target circle -- and even then, only with the help of its partner Attacker.  The Runner distracts the Turret and ends up being neutralized in order that the Penetrator can be guaranteed to hit the target circle.  We formulate the Turret-Runner-Penetrator scenario as a differential game over the Value of the subsequent game of min/max terminal angle which takes place between the Turret and Penetrator once the Runner has been neutralized.  The solution to the Game of Degree, including equilibrium Turret, Runner, and Penetrator strategies, as well as the Value function are given.  The case in which the Penetrator can reach the target before the Turret can neutralize the Runner is formulated and solved.  Finally, the assumption of a priori defined roles/goals is relaxed and the minimum of the solutions to the two fixed-role games is shown to be a Global Stackelberg Equilibrium.},

  abstract = {In this paper, the problem of guarding a circular target wherein the Defender(s) is constrained to move along its perimeter is posed and solved using a differential game theoretic approach. Both the one-Defender and two-Defender scenarios are analyzed and solved. The mobile Attacker seeks to reach the perimeter of the circular target, whereas the Defender(s) seeks to align itself with the Attacker, thereby ending the game. In the former case, the Attacker wins, and the Attacker and Defender play a zero sum differential game where the payoff/cost is the terminal angular separation. In the latter case, the Defender(s) wins, and the Attacker and Defender play a zero sum differential game where the cost/payoff is the Attacker’s terminal distance to the target. This formulation is representative of a scenario in which the Attacker inflicts damage on the target as a function of its terminal distance. The state-feedback equilibrium strategies and Value functions for the Attacker-win and Defender(s)-win scenarios are derived for both the one- and two-Defender cases, thus providing a solution to the Game of Degree. Analytic expressions for the separating surfaces between the various terminal scenarios are derived, thus providing a solution to the Game of Kind.},

@inproceedings{vonmoll2020evolutionary,
  abstract = {In this paper a scenario is considered in which a group of predators cooperate to maximize the number of prey captures over a finite time horizon on a two-dimensional plane. The emphasis is on developing predator strategies, and thus the behavior of the prey agents is fixed to a Boids-like flocking model which incorporates avoidance of nearby predators. At each time instant, the predators have control authority over their heading angle; however, we restrict the headings to be governed by one of five different pre-specified behaviors. No communication occurs between the predator agents - each agent determines its own control without knowledge of what the other predators will implement; thus, the predator strategies are fully decentralized. The full state space of the system is collapsed to a set of features which is independent of the number of prey. An evolutionary algorithm is used to evolve an anchor point controller wherein the anchor point lies in the feature space and has a particular predator behavior associated, thus providing a candidate solution to the question of "what to do when". The two predator case is the focus in this work, although the ideas could be applied to larger groups of predators. The strategies resulting from the evolutionary algorithm favor aiming at the nearest prey mostly, and also avoiding having the predators getting too close and then pursuing the same prey. Thus useless behaviors are generally not present among the elite at the end of the evolutionary process.},

We derive an analytical expression for the value function of the game and use a hold time to derive the rate of change for the loss of the time to capture along the dispersal line. Then we resolve the dilemma along the dispersal line using actions defined by the saddle point of the rate of change for the loss. Finally, we analyze the same game in a version with a non-zero hold time and show that in that case, the actions from the dispersal line have to be applied not only on the dispersal line, but in a narrow band around it.

  abstract = {Thermal management has emerged as one of the primary challenges for modern military gas turbine engines. Fuel actuator pumping systems contribute to the challenge by constantly injecting waste heat into the fuel system. This is due to a fundamental mismatching between an actuation system with a low duty cycle and a pump which is always running. Since the pump is directly coupled to the gearbox, the detriment is twofold: horsepower is always being drawn to drive the pump, and heat is generated. Furthermore, the emergence of variable cycle engines pushes the actuation system in the direction of more effectors and more loads, which drives requirements for high pressure and high flows from the pumping system. Piston pumps have been seen as favorable for the actuation pump application due to their high single stage pressure rise capability. However reducing the number of pumping components alone has not solved the thermal management issue. Variable displacement pumps have been designed to operate over a range of conditions in order to deliver flow more appropriately as demanded by the control system. These pumps allow pressure and flow to be modulated independent of one another and of the pump’s rotational speed. Variable displacement pumps may be considered as a component of a partial-demand actuation pumping system. Even in a partial-demand actuation pumping system, a variable displacement pump will still be coupled to the gearbox and require some minimum flow for lubrication and cooling. On-demand actuation fuel systems deliver only the amount of flow that is being demanded at a given time so that waste heat is minimized. In other words, the duty cycle of the pumping system matches that of the actuation system. The development of an on-demand actuation fuel system will require a new architecture and new components.},

The concept of smart components is built around actively controlling the engine and the aircraft to operate optimally. Usage of smart components intelligently increases efficiency and system safety throughout the flight envelope, all while meeting environmental challenges. This approach requires an integration and optimization, both at the local level and the system level, to reduce cost. Interactions between the various subsystems must be understood through the use of modeling and simulation. This is accomplished by starting with individual subsystem models and combining them into a complete system model. Hierarchical, decentralized control reduces cost and risk by enabling integration and modularity.

  abstract = {The exhaust gas temperature (EGT) is typically defined as the gas temperature at the exit of the turbine; the sensors used to measure this parameter are considered the most vulnerable elements of the entire turbine engine instrumentation. EGT measurement is considered a key parameter for optimizing fuel economy, diagnosis, and prognosis. The reason is that turbine blade temperature is a good indicator for normal life consumption of that blade. Currently, direct sensor measurements made on turbine modules are limited due to the extremely hot environment. Exhaust gas temperature (EGT) sensors located downstream from the highest temperature sections provide a means to roughly infer the temperatures seen by the turbine blades/disks. But these sensors, which themselves are subject to frequent failures, provide a fairly inaccurate indication of the actual metal temperature profiles. This is of particular importance for high performance military turbine engines where the margin between hot-section operating conditions and material limitations is shrinking. A future state is envisioned that would use emerging pyrometric, fiber optic, and laser-based sensing to accurately assess the condition and life usage of the hot section, on a blade-by-blade basis.},

Exact methods for solving the problem have recently been put forth, however, in the absence of additional heuristics, the exact method scales poorly for problems with more than 10 sites or so. By using a genetic algorithm, performance and computation time can be traded off depending on the application. The main contributions are a novel chromosome encoding scheme and genetic operators for cyclic walks which may visit sites more than once.

This report explores one particular area of interest: trajectory optimization. The Linear Quadratic Regulator and Linear Quadratic Gaussian algorithms are introduced as predecessors to the Iterative Linear Quadratic Gaussian (iLQG) algorithm, which is re-derived in this report and demonstrated on 3 systems of interest: cartpole, double cartpole, and quadrotor. iLQG is robust and widely applicable to a vast number of different systems. Probabilistic Differential Dynamic Programming (PDDP) is introduced as an important extension to iLQG which incorporates uncertainty into the trajectory optimization process. The conceptual advances presented in this report were centered around the use of a Gaussian Process Regression Network (GPRN) to represent the unknown system dynamics in lieu of the standard Gaussian Process representation employed by PDDP. GPRNs offer a more sophisticated noise model and a more adaptive regression framework. More speciffcally, they incorporate input-dependent noise and signal correlation between multiple outputs. This should enhance the predictive capability of the algorithm to represent the unknown system dynamics. Work remains on fully incorporating GPRN into a PDDP-like algorithm: effort continues in the areas of understanding variational Bayes and variational message passing for learning GPRN hyperparameters, and in creating a MATLAB implementation.},

The players have simple motion à la Isaacs and the pursuers are faster than the evader. We confine our attention to the case where the pursuers have the same speed, so the game’s parameter is the evader/pursuers speed ratio 0 < µ < 1. State feedback capture strategies and an evader strategy which yields a lower bound on his time-to-capture are devised using a geometric method. It is shown that in group/swarm pursuit, when the players are in general position, capture is effected by one, two, or by three critical pursuers, and this irrespective of the size N (> 3) of the pursuit pack.  Group pursuit devolves into pure pursuit by one of the pursuers or into a pincer movement pursuit by two or three pursuers who isochronously capture the evader, a mènage à trois. The critical pursuers are identified. However, these geometric method-based pursuit and evasion strategies are optimal only in a part of the state space where a strategic saddle point is obtained and the Value of the differential game is established, and as such, are suboptimal. To fully explore the differential game’s high dimensional state space and get a better understanding of group pursuit, numerical experimentation is undertaken.

The data collection task is undertaken by a UAV which autonomously executes the mission. Each node has a priority/ weight associated with it that characterizes the relative importance between timely collection of data from the nodes. In this context, a prudent performance metric is the maximal weighted time between consecutive visits to each node. We wish to minimize the maximum of this metric among all nodes for a given cycle length. Here, the cycle length refers to the total number of nodes (including repeats) visited per cycle. When the cycle length is greater than the number of nodes, some nodes, arguably ones with a higher priority, will be visited more often. We pose the problem as a Mixed Integer Linear Program (MILP), that computes the optimal visit sequence and number of visits to each node for a given cycle length. Not surprisingly, the exact method is not scalable with the number of nodes and the cycle length. We therefore present sub-optimal methods  by directly enforcing a pre-specified number of visits to each node. We present an iterative scheme that computes solutions for increasing cycle length with a recipe for updating the number of visits based on the solution from the previous iteration. We compare the optimal and sub-optimal iterative schemes and show that the sub-optimal scheme is an order of magnitude faster than the optimal scheme with minimal loss in performance.},

We assume that the distance between initial position of the pursuer and any point on the target circle is greater than four times the minimum turn radius of the pursuer, and prove the continuity of the Dubins paths of type Circle-Straight line-Circle with respect to the position on the target circle. This is used to prove that the optimal interception paths is a Dubins path, and present an iterative scheme to find the interception point on the target circle.},

  abstract = {In this paper an N-pursuer vs. M-evader team conflict is studied. The differential game of border defense is addressed and we focus on the game of degree in the region of the state space where the pursuers are able to win. This work extends classical differential game theory to simultaneously address weapon assignments and multi-player pursuit-evasion scenarios. Saddle-point strategies that provide guaranteed performance for each team regardless of the actual strategies implemented by the opponent are devised. The players' optimal strategies require the co-design of cooperative optimal assignments and optimal guidance laws. A representative measure of performance is proposed and the Value function of the game is obtained. It is shown that the Value function is continuous, continuously differentiable, and that it satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation - the curse of dimensionality is overcome and the optimal strategies are obtained. The cases of N=M and N>M are considered. In the latter case, cooperative guidance strategies are also developed in order for the pursuers to exploit their numerical advantage. This work provides a foundation to formally analyze complex and high-dimensional conflicts between teams of N pursuers and M evaders by means of differential game theory.},

  abstract = {We extend the Turret Defense Differential Game by considering the possibility for the mobile Attacker to retreat to a particular region of the state space in lieu of engaging the Turret. In this case, the Turret cooperates with the Attacker by escorting the Attacker to the retreat surface, thereby minimizing its cost. Along the retreat trajectory, the cost associated with the Value of the Game of Engagement must be greater than the cost associated with retreating. We refer to this scenario as Optimal Constrained Retreat, wherein the aforementioned requirement is imposed as a path constraint. The optimality conditions are developed herein. We specify a boundary value problem with fixed initial state and compute the optimal trajectory numerically via backwards shooting. The corresponding trajectory contains a constrained arc wherein the path constraint associated with the Game of Engagement becomes active.},

We collapse the five natural parameters of capture radius, attacker speed, turret turn rate, time penalty constant, and look-angle penalty constant into two composite parameters in order to facilitate the analysis. There exist three singular surfaces in the game, two of which have an analytic form, and one which can only be obtained numerically. We focus on the latter: the Attacker Dispersal Surface, wherein the attacker can choose between an indirect or direct route to capture. For certain parameter settings, the Attacker Dispersal Surface is present, while for others, the surface is absent. These regions in the parameter space are identified, and the numerical procedures to do so are detailed. Backwards shooting of the optimal state and adjoint dynamics features prominently in the procedures. Two pieces of numerical evidence are utilized to indicate the presence or absence of the Attacker Dispersal Surface.},

In this scenario, the observer is endowed with a nonzero radius of observation within which he strives at keeping the target for as long as possible. Using the calculus of variations we pose and solve the optimal control problem, solving for the heading of the observer which maximizes the amount of time the target remains inside the radius of observation. Utilizing the optimal observer heading we compute the exposure time based upon the angle by which the target is initially captured. Presented, along with an example, are the zero-time of exposure heading, maximum time of observation heading, and proof that observation is persistent under optimal control.},

This paper addresses the question of whether or not either player has the ability to exploit the dispersal surface. Specifically, we in- vestigate the case where the Evader effectively stands still (e.g., by dithering in a small neighborhood). We show that the canonical optimal pursuit policy yields chattering in the discrete-time version of the game. As the timestep approaches zero, the capture time approaches the Value of the game, and thus the Evader is not penalized for standing still. Implications on related scenarios are discussed.},

@article{vonmoll2019robust,
  abstract = {Analysis of the pursuit-evasion differential game consisting of multiple pursuers and single evader with simple motion is difficult due to the wellknown curse of dimensionality. Policies have been proposed for this scenario, and we show that these policies are Global Stackelberg equilibrium strategies.  However we also show that they are not saddle point equilibria in the feedback sense. The argument is twofold: there are cases where the saddle point condition is violated, and cases where the strategy profiles are not time consistent (subgame perfect). The issue of capturability is explored, and sufficient conditions for guaranteed capture are provided. A new pursuit policy is proposed which guarantees capture while also providing an upper bound for capture time. The Evader policy corresponding to the Global Stackelberg equilibrium is shown to provide a lower bound for capture time. Thus these policies are robust from the Pursuer and Evader perspectives, respectively, should they implement them. Several other interesting pursuit and evasion policies are explored and compared with the robust policies in a series of experiments.},

In this paper, we pose and solve a variant of Isaacs' Two Cutters and Fugitive Ship problem wherein the Pursuers' strategy is fixed to Pure Pursuit, thus making it an optimal control problem. The Pursuers are faster than the Evader and are endowed with a finite capture radius. All agents move with constant velocity and can change heading instantaneously. Although capture is inevitable, the Evader wishes to delay capture as long as possible. The optimal trajectories cover the entire state space.

The main objective of this investigation is to exploit the benefits of cooperation amongst the pursuers in order to reduce the capture time of the evader. Computational complexity is a chief concern as this problem would need to be solved in an online fashion, e.g. in the case of autonomous unmanned aerial vehicles. A new geometric approach to solving the game is introduced and analyzed, which changes the problem of optimizing over continuous domains to a discrete combinatoric optimization. While past efforts at solving multiple pursuer problems have suffered from the curse of dimensionality, the geometric algorithms put forth here are shown to be scalable. Categorization and removal of redundant pursuers is the primary means by which scalability is achieved. The solution of this problem serves as a stepping stone to more complex problems such as the M-pursuer N-evader differential game.},

It is shown that traditional means of differential game analysis is difficult for this scenario. But simple motion and min-max time to capture plus the two-person extension to Pontryagin's maximum principle imply straight-line motion at maximum speed which forms the basis of the solution using a geometric approach. Safe evader paths and policies are defined which guarantee the evader can reach its destination without getting captured by any of the pursuers, provided its destination satisfies some constraints. A linear program is used to characterize the solution and subsequently the saddle-point is computed numerically. We replace the numerical procedure with a more analytical geometric approach based on Voronoi diagrams after observing a pattern in the numerical results. The solutions derived are open-loop optimal, meaning the strategies are a saddle-point equilibrium in the open-loop sense.},
