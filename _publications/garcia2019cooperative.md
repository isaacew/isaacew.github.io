A pursuit-evasion problem with two pursuers and one evader is considered. The evader aims at reaching a goal line which is protected by the pursuers. When reaching this goal is not possible, the Evader strives to position itself as close as possible with respect to the goal line at the time of capture. The pursuers try to capture the evader as far as possible from the goal line. The problem is posed as a zero-sum differential game where the two pursuers cooperate against the evader. State feedback strategies are derived in this paper and the Value function is obtained. It is also shown that the Value function is continuous, continuously differentiable, and it satisfies the Hamilton-Jacobi-Isaacs equation.
